                                <h2>Cryptocurrency Trading</h2>
                                <p>Cryptocurrency Trading is the Forex (Foreign Exchange) of cryptocurrencies. This means, you are able to trade different bitcoin
                                    and altcoin normally for USD and BTC.Cryptocurrency Trading is an alternative way to get involved in the Crypto-World! It doesn’t
                                    require mining hardware nor investing in bitcoin hyips or bitcoin cloud mining (which always has risk involved in their integrity).</p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>We use Automated Cryptocurrency bots</h2>

                                <p>The human mind can only follow several indicators at a given time. A Bitcoin (or other crypto-currency) bot can follow and
                                    try all the indicators at any time on all the cryptocoins. A Bitcoin bot doesn’t need sleep – a bot can be active at any
                                    time you wish, this allows to have a better sound, because you can be sure, that the bot will trade if something crucial happens.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>Bitcoin Bots are accessible</h2>
                                <p>Financial bots have existed for many years, but they were only accessible to the brokers and banks.
                                    Just the Bloomberg API cost 10000$ per year. Bitcoin Bots are different.
                                    They are managed on an external cloud/server, which means you don’t need to have your computer running all the time.
                                    The strategies are pseudo-coded – so you can say for example, if this indicator crosses that indicator, then buy.
                                    Else wait for that indicator. Most bots are user made with different ratings, which allow you to choose easily
                                    from several strategies, without the need to program any code at all.</p>
