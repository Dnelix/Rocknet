                                <h2>Forex & CFD</h2>
                                <p style="display: block;">Basically, the Forex market is where banks, businesses, governments, investors and traders come to exchange and speculate on currencies.
                                    The Forex market is also referred to as the ‘Fx market’, ‘Currency market’, ‘Foreign exchange currency market’ or ‘Foreign currency market’,
                                    and it is the largest and most liquid market in the world with an average daily turnover of $3.98 trillion.</p>
                                    <br><br>
                                <p style="display: block;">The Fx market is open 24 hours a day, 5 days a week with the most important world trading centers
                                    being located in London, New York, Tokyo, Zurich, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, Paris, and Sydney.<br>
                                    It should be noted that there is no central marketplace for the Forex market; trading is instead said to be conducted ‘over the counter’;
                                    it’s not like stocks where there is a central marketplace with all orders processed like the NYSE.</p>
                                <br><br>
                                <p style="display: block;">Forex is a product quoted by all the major banks, and not all banks will have the exact same price.
                                    Now, the broker platforms take all theses feeds from the different banks and the quotes we see from our broker are an
                                    approximate average of them. It’s the broker who is effectively transacting the trade and taking the other side of it…they
                                    ‘make the market’ for you. When you buy a currency pair…your broker is selling it to you, not ‘another trader’.</p>
                                <br ><br>
                                <p style="display: block;">Forex trading as it relates to retail traders (like you and I) is the speculation on the price of one currency against another.
                                    For example, if you think the euro is going to rise against the U.S. dollar, you can buy the EURUSD currency pair low and then (hopefully)
                                    sell it at a higher price to make a profit. Of course, if you buy the euro against the dollar (EURUSD), and the U.S.
                                    dollar strengthens, you will then be in a losing position. So, it’s important to be aware of the risk involved in trading Forex, and not only the reward.
