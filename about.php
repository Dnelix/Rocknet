                                <h2>Overview</h2>
                                <p>RocknetFx is a major international private equity group focused on investing in market-
                                    leading businesses, working with management teams to create and realise value within

                                    its portfolio companies.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>Buyouts</h2>

                                <p>At RocknetFx we look to invest in strong-performing, good quality, well-managed
                                    businesses that have the potential to grow - for example through expansion, operational
                                    improvement or acquisition.
                                    We'll achieve that growth by working directly with management teams, typically over a
                                    three to five year period, sharing our industrial, commercial and financial expertise. We
                                    believe that this collaborative approach, working with experienced managers, delivers
                                    superior performance.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>Acquisitions with Management</h2>
                                <p>We're a people-centric business, and our style is to work openly and collaboratively
                                    with management teams.<br>
                                    We serve on company boards, and contribute to a business's strategic development via
                                    their executive teams. We also motivate managers through equity participation, so they
                                    can realise their own financial rewards for the value they create.
                                    We've worked extensively with over 300 management teams across Europe and in
                                    many sectors to help them target, fund and then acquire competitors, improve their
                                    operations or even expand product and service ranges. In our experience, access to
                                    <br>
                                    funding accompanied by strategic sector and commercial insight is key to value
                                    creation.<br>
                                    As a result, we have a reputation for building value and scale, and thereby making
                                    businesses stronger and better positioned for exit.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>Our Values & Culture</h2>
                                <p>Our ultimate aim is to be the international private equity manager of choice for our
                                    investors, and the management and employees of portfolio companies everywhere we
                                    operate.<br>
                                    To achieve this, we strive to maintain the highest levels of corporate
                                    governance, applying standards of professionalism uniformly across the firm.
                                    We work hard to maintain these standards, and this is reflected in the management
                                    structure: the Firm is led by 25 partners and managed by a Group Board. This board
                                    has executive responsibility for setting the Firm's strategy. An Investment Advisory
                                    Committee comprising members of the group board as well as other partners with
                                    specific sector or operating expertise reach investment decisions for the Firm.
                                    We have three core guiding values, that we believe help us manage RocknetFx, and
                                    the businesses we own, more effectively.</p>
